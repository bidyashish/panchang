Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Context**:
   - The project is an astronomical calculator that verifies Panchanga (Hindu calendar) details against a reference website (DrikPanchang.com).
   - It uses Swiss Ephemeris for precise astronomical calculations.
   - The primary goal is to ensure the accuracy of Panchanga calculations for a specific date and location.

2. **Coding Guidelines**:
   - Follow best practices for code organization and modularity.
   - Use descriptive variable and function names for clarity.
   - Include error handling and validation for user inputs.
   - Write unit tests to cover critical functionality.
   - Document the codebase with comments and README files.
   - Ensure compliance with licensing and attribution requirements for third-party libraries.
